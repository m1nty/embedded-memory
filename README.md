## Embedded Memories and an External SRAM Interface

<a name="objective"></a>
### Objective

To understand how to build and simulate a digital system containing embedded memory blocks, such as read-only memory (ROM), single-port random access memory (RAM), and dual-port RAM. To gain experience with design verification using SystemVerilog testbenches and the ModelSim simulation environment. To design and implement a self-test engine for an external static RAM (SRAM) memory.
